		<main>
			<p>
				It feels a little longer than 3 years, I'm not sure why. I'm
				glad it hasn't been that long, I feel like I haven't grown
				enough, but I assume that's something most people feel and I'm
				also quite certain that feeling is a trap.
			</p>
			<p>
				I often find it hard to complain about work, or life in general;
				I have a privileged job, live in a first world country, have
				never experienced financial hardship - this list probably goes
				on for quite a while. On the contrary, I've been finding it hard
				to be overjoyed about things recently (I know this is sounding
				quite depressive so far, I promise I'm ok), but it's hard to get
				excited when you know it doesn't really matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				You know, what's the point of getting excited about some cool
				new AI feature that work is implementing when you know AI is now
				a massive contributor to climate change (something that actually
				matters). It's hard also, because at times it feels like you are
				going crazy, you think; does anyone else feel this way? Software
				is especially strange in this regard - people often adopt it as
				their entire personality...
			</p>

			<p>
				It becomes a mark against your name if you're not doing 47 side
				projects after work and maintaining a personal development list.
				This is obviously not the case for everyone (probably not the
				case for most people (most of the time, it's not even the case
				for me!)), and of course there are people who are extremely
				passionate, regardless of external pressures. There is also
				always the option of not participating in this - which is all
				well and good, but sometimes, just sometimes, you feel a little
				surrounded by an almost hustle culture like attitude.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'll try to summarise my problem over the next couple of
				paragraphs. Because it's not that there are people working hard
				to become better developers, self improvement and learning is
				absolutely a good thing - the problem lies with what we are
				<i>actually</i> doing, the end result, andy sometimes the why.
			</p>

			<p>
				People grind, and to what end? Did the work contribute to a life
				saving medical device? Is some of your code part of something
				that is positively impacting the world, or doing anything that
				matters? Of course the word 'matters' could be defined in a
				myriad of ways, but I think you get the point. Are we, in the
				end, just shoveling more coal into this unstoppable, nonsensical
				capitalist ship.
			</p>

			<p>
				You have people, where their goal is become a Senior dev at x or
				y company (insert FAANG company here), just for the imaginary
				validation that would come with being hired there... That you
				would now be a 'good' developer and happiness would finally be
				attained. Why is this is such a popular goal? Why is not popular
				to want to be a 'good' person? Or work somewhere that almost
				undoubtedly does 'good'? It's normalised to work hard, to only
				the company's benefit, or to climb the imaginary rungs and get
				hired somewhere with more clout... Hard not feel like it's a
				trap that way too many people are falling into.
			</p>

			<p>
				And I know, there's 'amazing' engineering cultures/higher
				salaries at these places, you want to be/get a part of it -
				that's cool, I get it. It's just when you start to peel back the
				layers regarding work culture and why, it's hard to not to see a
				well disguised, toxic, hustle culture at the core, one that's
				been fed to us by people who benefit.
			</p>

			<p>
				This, of course, doesn't apply to everywhere or everyone - but
				it does it seem to be a rather infectious disease... For
				example; How many clickbait, rubbish, 'technical' articles are
				posted to reddit programming subs or HN these days? It's absurd.
			</p>

			<p>
				To summarise the small rant above - I just wish people cared
				more about <i>what</i> they were working on/toward. Sometimes it
				feels like such a race to the bottom.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyway, it's not all bad, I'm enjoying the journey I'm on
				(contrary to everything above) - dev work is fun and rewarding,
				I've recently dabbled in TDD - which I'm discovering is pretty
				cool! I'm also learning more about the cloud (this is much less
				fun). I'd love to do some work in developing new API's or CLI
				tools; but hey, there's plenty of time for everything...
